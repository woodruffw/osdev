Files pertaining to my self-education in OS development and systems programming.

Files are organized by folder, but may not be documented.

Tested with bochs: http://bochs.sourceforge.net/

To run each example, load bochs with the configuration (.bxrc) file in each directory.

Common routines (printing, etc) are stored in the "include" directory
